## How it works

The 8-bit Johnson counter is the simplest possible state machine with 8-bit states as it uses just 8 flip-flops and no other combinational gate. The output sequence is a Moebius sequence.

## How to test

First reset then clock and check that the output sequence is a Moebius sequence.

## External hardware

Could connect the output to 8 LEDs to see the Moebius sequence in action
